<h2>Issue tracker</h2>

<p>
ScalaMock issues can be submitted to our <a href="https://github.com/paulbutcher/ScalaMock/issues">issues page</a> on github.
</p>

<h2>Stack Overflow</h2>

<p>
You can also ask questions on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/scalamock?sort=newest">Stack Overflow</a> with <code>#scalamock</code> tag - we have subscription for questions tagged "scalamock".
</p>

<h2>Disqus</h2>

<p>
ScalaMock does not have its own mailing list - we believe mailing lists are too cumbersome to use and can be easily replaced by dedicated software or services: issue trackers for
bug reports and feature requests, Stack Overflow for community support and solving specific problems, Twitter for announcements, etc.
</p>
<p>Anyway, you can still leave your comment or question using Disqus. <em>Guest posts are allowed</em> and you don't have to enter valid e-mail address. Also no one will see your post until
it's accepted.</p>
