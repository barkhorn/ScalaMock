This article describes how to use ScalaMock in your tests. Because it is just an introduction to ScalaMock, it describes only the basic usage of this mocking framework. For more details please refer to the [User Guide](/user-guide/).

## Installation

To use ScalaMock in [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) with [ScalaTest](http://www.scalatest.org/) add the following to your project file:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.scalamock" %% "scalamock-scalatest-support" % "3.4.2" % Test
```

If you don't use sbt or ScalaTest please check the [Installation](/user-guide/installation/) chapter in the User Guide.

The sample code described in this article is available on [GitHub](http://github.com/pawel-wiejacha/scalamock-examples).

## Leaderboad example 

This example assumes that we're writing code that is responsible for updating a Country Leaderboard (i.e. *Top Countries*) every time a match between two players finishes in an online multiplayer game. 

They say that picture is worth a thousand words, so before we get into details let's look at a diagram:

![Diagram](/assets/img/sm_qs_leaderboard.png)

The `Player` class represents a player and `MatchResult` describes the result of a played game between two players. Each player has its unique id and country it came from:

```scala
type PlayerId = Int
case class Player(id: PlayerId, nickname: String, country: Country)
case class MatchResult(winner: PlayerId, loser: PlayerId)
```

There is also the `CountryLeaderboard` trait that describes the Country Leaderboard interface:

```scala
case class CountryLeaderboardEntry(country: Country, points: Int)

trait CountryLeaderboard {
  def addVictoryForCountry(country: Country): Unit
  def getTopCountries(): List[CountryLeaderboardEntry]
}
```

The class we are going to test is called `MatchResultObserver` since its responsibility is to observe created `MatchResult` instances:

```scala
class MatchResultObserver(playerDatabase: PlayerDatabase, countryLeaderBoard: CountryLeaderboard) {
  def recordMatchResult(result: MatchResult): Unit = {
    val player = playerDatabase.getPlayerById(result.winner)
    countryLeaderBoard.addVictoryForCountry(player.country)
  }
}
```

Finally, there is the `PlayerDatabase` trait that provides an abstract interface for accessing player information from some database:

```scala
trait PlayerDatabase {
  def getPlayerById(playerId: PlayerId): Player
}
```

As mentioned before, the `MatchResultObserver` is the class we are going to test. We assume that all classes that implement `PlayerDatabase` and `CountryLeaderboard` traits are tested in different test suites.

### Objects interacting with tested class

`MatchResultObserver` is a very simple class and it should be easy to test it. Unfortunately the only available implementation of `PlayerDatabase` is one that uses some relational database to store and retrieve players:

```scala
class RealPlayerDatabase(
  dbConnectionPool: DbConnectionPool,
  databaseConfig: DatabaseConfig,
  securityManager: SecurityManager,
  transactionManager: TransactionManager) extends PlayerDatabase {

  override def getPlayerById(playerId: PlayerId) = ???
}
```

It would be a nightmare to setup a database, fill it with sample players, create all of `RealPlayerDatabase`'s dependencies (like `TransactionManager`) and the dependencies of those dependencies. 

Fortunately, mocking is useful in this kind of situation because instead of testing `MatchResultObserver` with `RealPlayerDatabase` we can test it with a much simpler `PlayerDatabase` implementation. We could directly implement `PlayerDatabase`, for example:

```
class FakePlayerDatabase extends PlayerDatabase {
    override def getPlayerById(playerId: PlayerId) : Player = {
        if (playerId == 222) return Player(222, "boris", Countries.Russia)
        else if (playerId == 333) return Player(333, "hans", Countries.Germany)
        else ???
    }
}
```

In this case it does not look that bad. But implementing complex traits or having a fake implementation generic enough to handle all test cases can be a really cumbersome and error-prone task.

This is where ScalaMock comes into play.

### Stubbing objects interacting with tested class

With ScalaMock you can create objects that pretend to implement some trait or interface. Then you can instruct that "faked" object how it should respond to all interactions with it. For example:

```scala
// create fakeDb stub that implements PlayerDatabase trait
val fakeDb = stub[PlayerDatabase] 

// configure fakeDb behavior 
(fakeDb.getPlayerById _) when(222) returns(Player(222, "boris", Countries.Russia))
(fakeDb.getPlayerById _) when(333) returns(Player(333, "hans", Countries.Germany))

// use fakeDb
assert(fakeDb.getPlayerById(222).nickname == "boris")
```

### Mocking objects interacting with tested class

ScalaMock supports both two mocking styles: *Expectations-First Style* (mocks) and *Record-then-Verify* (stubs). 
Previously we used a stub to create a fake `PlayerDatabase` and now we will use a mock `CountryLeaderboard` to set our test expectations:

```scala
// create CountryLeaderboard mock
val countryLeaderBoardMock = mock[CountryLeaderboard]

// set expectations
(countryLeaderBoardMock.addVictoryForCountry _).expects(Countries.Germany)

// use countryLeaderBoardMock
countryLeaderBoardMock.addVictoryForCountry(Countries.Germany) // OK
countryLeaderBoardMock.addVictoryForCountry(Countries.Russia)  // throws TestFailedException
```

To read more about the differences between mocks and stubs please check [Choosing your mocking style](/user-guide/mocking_style/) chapter in the User Guide.

### Testing with ScalaMock

To provide mocking support in ScalaTest suites just mix your suite with `org.scalamock.scalatest.MockFactory`:

```scala
import org.scalamock.scalatest.MockFactory
import org.scalatest.FlatSpec

class MatchResultObserverTest extends FlatSpec with MockFactory {

  val winner = Player(id = 222, nickname = "boris", country = Countries.Russia)
  val loser = Player(id = 333, nickname = "hans", country = Countries.Germany)

  "MatchResultObserver" should "update CountryLeaderBoard after finished match" in {
    val countryLeaderBoardMock = mock[CountryLeaderboard]
    val userDetailsServiceStub = stub[PlayerDatabase]

    // set expectations
    (countryLeaderBoardMock.addVictoryForCountry _).expects(Countries.Russia)

    // configure stubs
    (userDetailsServiceStub.getPlayerById _).when(loser.id).returns(loser)
    (userDetailsServiceStub.getPlayerById _).when(winner.id).returns(winner)

    // run system under test
    val matchResultObserver = new MatchResultObserver(userDetailsServiceStub, countryLeaderBoardMock)
    matchResultObserver.recordMatchResult(MatchResult(winner = winner.id, loser = loser.id))
  }
}
```

To use ScalaMock with different testing frameworks please check the [Integration with testing frameworks](/user-guide/integration/) chapter in the User Guide.

## Further reading

ScalaMock has many powerful [features](/user-guide/features/). The example below shows some of them:

```scala
val httpClient = mock[HttpClient]
val counterMock = mock[Counter]

inAnyOrder {
  (httpClient.sendRequest _).expects(Method.GET, *, *).twice
  (httpClient.sendRequest _).expects(Method.POST, "http://scalamock.org", *).noMoreThanOnce
  (httpClient.sendRequest _).expects(Method.POST, "http://example.com", *).returning(Http.NotFound)
  inSequence {
    (counterMock.increment _) expects(*) onCall { arg: Int => arg + 1}
    (counterMock.decrement _) expects(*) onCall { throw new RuntimeException() }
  }
}
```

Please read the [User Guide](/user-guide/) for more details.
