# FAQ

## 1. Thread-safety

**Question**: Is ScalaMock thread-safe? Can mocks be used in multi-threaded environment?

**Answer**: Yes. ScalaMock is thread-safe and mocks can be used in multi-threaded environment. This means that:

* ScalaMock will work with tests that are run in parallel 
  * Specs2 runs tests in parallel by default and
  * ScalaTest does so with `ParallelTestExecution`
* You can call mocks from other threads within tests
  * but any such calls must be complete before the test completes - it's an error to call a mock afterwards. 
* You can use mocks within `Futures`
